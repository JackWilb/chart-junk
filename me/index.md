# Our Goal



# Our Team

## Derya Akbaba

In her PhD work Derya uses critical theory as a lens for understanding the intersection of design and technology within the field of Information Visualization. With a less than “traditional” background in Labor Relations, Cognitive Science, and Economics, she is inspired by the intersections across disciplines and interrogating the differences (and similarities) that matter.

Prior to joining the University of Utah she worked for six years at a boutique data analytics company developing a propriety systems theory and building up the data visualization and design teams. She graduated from Cornell University with a BS in Industrial and Labor Relations with minors in Cognitive Science and Economics.

## Miriah Meyer

Miriah is an associate professor in the School of Computing at the University of Utah and a faculty member in the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute. She co-directs the Visualization Design Lab, which focuses on the design of visualization systems for helping people make sense of complex data, and on the development of methods for helping visualization designers make sense of the world. She obtained her bachelors degree in astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State University, and earned a PhD in computer science from the University of Utah. Prior to joining the faculty at Utah Miriah was a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard University and a visiting scientist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.

Miriah is the recipient of a NSF CAREER grant, a Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship, and a NSF/CRA Computing Innovation Fellow award. She was named a University of Utah Distinguished Alumni, both a TED Fellow and a PopTech Science Fellow, and included on MIT Technology Review's TR35 list of the top young innovators. She was also awarded an AAAS Mass Media Fellowship that landed her a stint as a science writer for the Chicago Tribune.

## Jack Wilburn

Jack is a data visualization software developer with the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute at the University of Utah. Through his work, Jack leads development efforts on over $3,000,000 of grant funded research into a broad range of topics, including multivariate network visualizations, neuromodulation therapy databases, and patient blood management analysis tools. Another critical part of Jack's work is mentoring PhD students in the Visualization Design Lab and helping the lab make quality, maintainable software. He obtained a Bachelor of Science Degree in Mathematics from Westminster College in Salt Lake City and is currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Utah.

In his prior work, Jack developed machine learning models for national banks and created custom lifetime value solutions for many US companies. Ultimately, Jack has developed and implemented tools that cover the whole data science stack, and he's comfortable explaining the complex technical topics to stakeholders from any background.

Jack's hobbies include:
- Taking Pusha (his cat) kayaking/hiking
- Rock climbing
- Spending quality time with his partner sampling Salt Lake City's best cocktails.
